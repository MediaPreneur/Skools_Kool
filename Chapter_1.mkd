# Exercise 4

Question:

Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.

For example, the symbols +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect.
The symbol for multiplication is *.

If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile?
What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

Answer:

## Average Time Per Mile

### Plan

1. Pace = T/D
2. Distance In Miles = 10 KM / 1.61 KM in a mile
3. Average Minutes Per MPH = 43.5/Distance in Miles

### Code

    distanceKm = 10
    timeMinutes = 43.5
    distanceMiles = distanceKm/1.61 # <type 'float'> 6.21118012422
    minutesPerMile = timeMinutes/distanceMiles # <type 'float'> 7.0035

## Average Speed in Miles Per Hour

### Plan

1. V = D/T
2. Average KM Per Minute = 10/43.5
3. Average KM Per Hour = Average KM Per Minute * 60 Minutes Per Hour
4. Average Miles Per Hour = Average KM Per Hour / 1.61 KM Per Mile

### Code

    distanceKm = 10
    timeMinutes = 43.5
    avgKmPerMinute = distanceKm/timeMinutes # <type 'float'> 0.229885057471
    avgKmPerHour = avgKmPerMinute*60 # <type 'float'> 13.7931034483
    avgMilesPerHour = avgKmPerHour/1.61 # <type 'float'> 8.56714499893
