Exercise 1:
Rewrite time_to_int (from Section Chapter_16.4) as a method. It is probably not appropriate to rewrite int_to_time as a method; what object you would invoke it on?

I attempted this already in Exercise_1_2_3.py, through the methods time.to_hms(), time.to_secods().
"""

"""
Exercise 2:
Write an init method for the Point class that takes x and y as optional parameters and assigns them to the corresponding attributes.

Done. See Chapter Chapter_15 Exercise 1
"""

"""
Exercise 3:
Write a str method for the Point class. Create a Point object and print it.

Done. See Chapter Chapter_15 Exercise 1
"""


"""
Exercise 4:
Write an add method for the Point class.

Done. See Chapter Chapter_15 Exercise 1.
"""

"""
Exercise 5:
Write an add method for Points that works with either a Point object or a tuple:
If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new Point whose x coordinate is the sum of the x coordinates of the operands, and likewise for the y coordinates.
If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the first element of the tuple to the x coordinate and the second element to the y coordinate, and return a new Point with the result.

Done. See Chapter Chapter_15 Exercise 1.
