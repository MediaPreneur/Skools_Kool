Chapter Two Exercises
=====================

# Exercise 1

Question:

If you type an integer with a leading zero, you might get a confusing error:

    >>> zipcode = 02492
                      ^
    SyntaxError: invalid token

Other numbers seem to work, but the results are bizarre:

    >>> zipcode = 02132
    >>> zipcode
    1114

Can you figure out what is going on? Hint: display the values 01, 010, 0100 and 01000.

Answer:

A leading '0' indicates to the interpreter that the number is a octal numeric literal (base 8).

# Exercise 2

Question:

Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:

    5
    x = 5
    x + 1

Now put the same statements into a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.

Answer:

    # From the interpreter
    >>> 5
    5
    >>> x = 5
    >>> x + 1
    6

Running a script with just the expressions yields no output. The script is processed by the interpreter and exits.

Running a script by transforming each expression into a print statement yields an error for the assignment statement.
I guess that's because the assignment statement is a statement already?

Also, a syntax error occurs due to white space in assignment statement.

Removing the white space from the assignment statement and converting expressions in lines 1 and 3 into
print statements yields proper output when run as a script.

# Exercise 3

Question:

Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

    width = 17
    height = 12.0
    delimiter = '.'

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

    width/2
    width/2.0
    height/3
    1 + 2 * 5
    delimiter * 5

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

Answer:

    width/2 # Guess: 8, int; Correct
    width/2.0 # Guess: 8.5, float; Correct
    height/3 # Guess: 4.0, float; Correct
    1 + 2 * 5 # Guess: 11, int; Correct
    delimiter * 5 # Guess: syntax error; Incorrect! '.....', string

# Exercise 4

Question:

Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:

1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Ï€ r3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? Hint: 392.7 is wrong!
2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?

Answer:

Question 1:

    >>> from math import pi
    >>> (4.0/3.0)*pi*5**3 # (4/3) returns 1 due to floor division!
    523.5987755982989

Question 2:

    >>> quantity = 60
    >>> coverPrice = 24.95
    >>> discount = 0.40
    >>> netCost = (coverPrice*quantity)-(coverPrice*quantity)*0.40
    >>> shipping = 3+(0.75*quantity)
    >>> totalCost = netCost + shipping
    946.199999999

Question 3:

    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> easyPaceSec = (8*60)+15
    >>> tempPaceSec = (7*60)+12
    >>> totalSec = (easyPaceSec*2)+(tempPaceSec*3)
    >>> startTime = datetime(1,1,1,6,52)
    >>> startTime
    datetime.datetime(1, 1, 1, 6, 52)
    >>> totalSecTimeDelta = timedelta(seconds=totalSec)
    >>> totalSecTimeDelta
    datetime.timedelta(0, 2286)
    >>> endTime = startTime + totalSecTimeDelta
    >>> endTime.time()
    datetime.time(7, 30, 6)
